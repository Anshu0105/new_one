I'm Anshuman Mishra, thrilled to embark on my journey as a freshman in Computer Science Engineering, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at CV Raman Global University, Bhubaneswar.

With a deep-seated passion for the cutting-edge realms of AI and ML, I'm on a quest to dive headfirst into the exciting developments shaping our future.

Currently immersing myself in coursework, projects, and self-study, I'm committed to unraveling the mysteries behind AI and ML concepts, algorithms, and their real-world applications.

Excited to channel my education and enthusiasm towards tackling tangible challenges and carving out meaningful contributions in the realm of AI and ML.

Eager to explore opportunities for internships, projects, and collaborations that not only hone my skills but also foster impactful innovation.
